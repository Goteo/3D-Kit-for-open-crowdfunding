3D-Kit-for-open-crowdfunding
============================

Set of materials for printing and facilitating knowledge and creation of crowdfunding campaigns for the Commons 

ENG

This repository holds the collection of files needed for printing materials for crowdfunding workshops by Goteo, like the ones described here: http://goteo.org/service/workshop 

Diagrams for boards

On the one hand, you would find PDF of diagrams for (1) discussing key factors and indicators for crowdfunding campaigns oriented to open projects (areas of the project itself, the project creators and the campaign outputs); (2) analyzing previously selected campaigns from real examples online based on levels of innovation, project status, proximity, etc; (3) voting area for simulating crowdfunding based on previous examples; (4) diagram for collaboratively identifying key individual rewards or perks at a given campaign idea; (5) diagram for collaboratively identifying key collective rewards (with copyleft licenses) at a given campaign idea; and finally (6) communication matrix combining types of receivers and motivations, where to allocate specific actions for the dissemination of the campaign.

These files should be printed in colour on different boards for one-to-one assessment up to 4 participants ideally with specific projects in mind.

Tokens for diagrams

On the other hand, the tokens needed for each diagram board are uploaded here in .3dm format, allowing for 3D printing of (1) pieces for key factors in crowdfunding; (2) pieces with numbers for classifying real campaigns as examples, discussed according to thermometers of indicators; (3) Goteo coins for simulation of crowdfunding using transparent plastic glasses numbered accordingly; (4) icons of different type for formats of individual and collective rewards, in order to be used with the corresponding diagrams.

Other material needed

For the workshops thereâ€™s other material needed in order to make the process work, such as:

- Transparent plastic cups or glasses 
- Printed files with summaries of real campaigns, for the thermometers of indicators 
- Small Postits for identifying perks and collective rewards on the corresponding diagrams, as well as on the campaign communication matrix

More info

Those materials could be used individually or even in small groups with people interested in crowdfunding for their own projects, where physical assessment is a key factor in order to go through all the possible activities, enabling discussion among participants and narrowing down when working on specific projects. If you are an institution or individual interested in training for this facilitation or get it as a service from the Goteo team for bigger groups up to 30, you can contact us at: http://goteo.org/contact
